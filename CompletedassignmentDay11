Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of engineering that deals with the development and maintenance of computer software products. It's importance is to create a usable,functional, safe and reliable softare products.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1 The Advent of High-level programming Languages(1950s-1960s). The introduction of languages like FORTRAN, COBOL revolutionized software development.
2 The emergence of structured programming(1970). This introduced concepts like modularity and clear control structures.
3. The rise of agile Methodologies.(2000). Agile frameworks such as scrum shifted software engineering from rigid sequential processes to morer iterative approaches. 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. requirement - Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirement.
2. design - Creating high-level and detailed designs of software architecture and user interface.
3. implementation - Activity of constructing a software solution to the customer's requirements.
4. testing - Process of validating that the solution meets the requirements.
5. Deployment - Releasing the software to user or customer.
6. Maintenance - Process of changing a system after it has been deployed.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology is a linear and sequential approach where each phase of software development must be completed before moving to the next, example, construction where its step by step whereas Agile methodology is an iterative and flexible approach focusing on collaboration and customer feedback. Example,a mobile app that gather user feedback and improve features.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer is responsible for writing codes and software solutions.
Quality Assuarance Engineer is responsible for checking ans maintaining the certain starndard set for a software product are met.
Project manager is responsible to oversee the development and delivery of software project.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are software programs that help developers write codes. Eg Visual Studio Code.
Version Control Systems are tools that help manage source codes. Eg Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Technical debts and Tight deadlines. They can be overcomed by effective communication and prioritizing tasks.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing- Individual program units or object classes are tested.
System testing- Software testing that verifies that an entire software system meets its requirements.
Integration testing- A software testing method that verifies that multiple parts of an appllication work together. 
Acceptance- Evaluating a system or system component to ensure it satisfies the specified requirements.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt enginnering is the process of crafting an instruction to a generative AI model to give a clear and concise output. It's importance is to help Ai models understand user intent and produce relevant output.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example of a vague prompt, ' What is the importance of eating citrus fruits?'
clear prompt' Importance of taking an orange?'
The improved prompt is more effective and gives me a clear and direct answer of the importance of taking an orange specifically other than general citrus fruits.
